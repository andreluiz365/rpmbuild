What is This?
-------------

This repo contains my own (or copied from someone else's and modified) custom RPM packages I use in
different infrastructures I need to operate.

Why Did You Create This?
------------------------

After working for many companies over the last decade and spending the first month of my work basically
building 3rd-party software full time I've decided to do it once, store the recipes on Github and use
the recipes whenever and wherever I need to.
